# BankCorp
### Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?

The lack of customer consent when sharing data with this third party for direct marketing purposes violates several principles of the GDPR:

- **Article 5(1)(a) (Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency)**:\
Lawfulness: The GDPR states that data must be processed in a lawful manner. Using customer data without explicit consent for marketing purposes with a third party is likely unlawful.
Fairness: Targeting financially vulnerable customers with payday loans can potentially exacerbate their financial situation, which is fundamendally unfair.
Transparency: Explaining the changes to their terms and conditions via email without clear, forthright communication lacks transparency.
- **Article 5(1)(b) (Purpose Limitation)**:\
Specific Purpose and Further Processing: Personal data must be collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes. BankCorp originally collected this data for managing customer accounts and bank services. Processing it for third party marketing deviates from its original purpose.
- **Article 5(1)(c) (Data Minimisation)**:\
Adequate, Relevant and Limited: Data must be limited to what is necessary for its purpose. Allowing access to customer data for marketing development likely exceeds what is necessary.
- **Article 5(1)(e) (Integrity and Confidentiality)**:\
Security: Providing a third party company access to BankCorp's systems is highly insecure. They must ensure that their data is protected from breaches.
Confidentiality: Customers' financial data is sensitive. Access to this data from a third party with negative publicity is likely to compromise confidentiality.
- **Article 7 (Conditions for Consent)**:\
The Controller (BankCorp) must ensure the data subject (customers) have consented to the processing of his or her personal data. Since BankCorp has processed customer data without explicit consent, this condition has been violated.

### What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?
- **Discrete nature of the cooperation**:\
 The fact that BankCorp plan to refrain from explicitly announcing this partnership due to the loan company's negative publicity suggests a lack of honesty regarding these changes.
- **Exploitation of vulnerable customers**:\
 The proposal targets financially disadvantaged individuals through direct marketing of loans towards individuals already struggling with credit card bills, which may lead them towards more debt. Bankcorp's duty is primarily towards its customers, and has a responsibility to protect their financial welfare rather than exposing them to harmful products. The nature of this marketing is therefore exploitative as the bank is benefitting at the expense of their customer's well-being.
- **Conflicts of Interest**:\
The proposal prioritises profit over customer welfare, which breaches ethical business convention. As a leading bank, BankCorp is incentivised to act in the interest of its customers, providing services that promote their financial health rather than potentially aggravating it.
- **Privacy and Security**:\
Giving a loan company access to customer data is an intrusion into these customers' private lives. This kind of data should be managed carefully and privately. There is a risk that the laon company could misuse this data for reasons outside of the agreement, especially considering their negative publicity.

### What could the company do to address these issues?

**Legal**:
- Obtaining explicit consent, open communication with users and maintaining integrity while handling personal information to ensure GDPR compliance for data collection.s
- Clearly communicate to the customers how their data is being used.
- By implementing opt-in and opt-out measures, customers then have agency over whether they recieve marketing communications from the payday loan company.
- Share only the minimum amount of data necessary, ensuring it is relevant and limited to what is required.
- Implement data protection agreements with the third party to ensure data is handled, processed and stored appropriately and securely.
- Ensure any third parties are heavily vetted and that any negative publicity they have recieved is taken into consideration when establishing partnerships.
- Ensure customer data is handled in the best interests of both the company and customer welfare.

**Ethical**:
- Offer support services to help customers manage their accounts and promote their financial health.
- Ensure open communication about how their data is processed and who it is shared with.
- Publicly disclose any partnerships with third parties.
- Offer personalised financial guidance to customers in debt, helping them to find viable solutions instead of high risk loans.

# Treasure Hunters

### Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?

This proposal doesn't inherently break any laws. However, there are potential legal considerations and risks the developers must be aware of.

- **Transparency**:\
Changes to the details of Treasure Hunters should be communicated in an honest and forthright manner.
- **GDPR Compliance**:\
Data collection must comply with the GDPR. This is particularly important in this case as it involves sensitive financial data.
- **Children's Data**:\
Parental consent is required for data collection of minors.
- **Secure Payments**:\
Payments must comply with financial regulations.

### What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?

- **Addictive Design**:\
The game is designed to motivate users to purchase in-game content like hints which can be seen as psychologically exploitative.
- **Lack of Parental Controls**:\
The gaming activity of children should have strict parental control to prevent excessive spending, maintain a healthy screen time and to ensure online safety.
- **Lack of Fair Advertising**:\
In-game purchases must be advertised in a truthful and nondeceptive manner to build trust, protect users and to avoid negative publicity.

### What could the company do to address these issues?

Legal:
- Maintain honesty in any changes to the details of in-game purchases, how they affect gameplay and provide clear and accurate pricing.
- Obtaining explicit consent, open communication with users and maintaining integrity while handling personal information to ensure GDPR compliance for data collection.
- Handle payments in a way that complies with relevant financial regulations with secure payments, customer authentication and monitoring transactions for fraud.

Ethical:
- Make amendments to the game design to minimise its addictive nature through limiting play time, balancing reward systems and clear communication of the costs of in-game purchases.
- With parental and age verification, educational resources for parents and clearly explaining the requirement for parental consent, mandatory parental consent for data collection of minors can be implemented.
- Routinely evaluate the effect of game design on user welfare with surveys, analysing gamplay to track player behaviour and applying behavioural psychology into the game mechanics in a healthy manner.
- By avoiding misleading claims, clearly disclosing any paid content and correcting any inaccuracies in advertisements, in-game content can advertised honestly.

# friends.com

### Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?

Collecting location data for advertisements raises some concerns according to the GDPR:

- **Article 5(1)(b) (Purpose Limitation)**:\
Personal data must be collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes. Sharing location data for advertisements deviates from the original purpose of the service.
- **Article 5(1)(c) (Data Minimisation)**:\
Collected data is required to be relevant. Sharing location data for advertising could be seen as irrelevant.
- **Article 6(1)(a) (Lawfulness of Processing)**:\
The GDPR states that data subjects must give consent to the processing of their data for one or more specific purposes. The passage doesn't explicitly mention users giving consent to sharing their location data with local businesses, so this principle may have been violated.
- **Article 7 (Conditions for Consent)**:\
The controller must be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing his or her personal data. Again, as there is no mention of consent within the passage this principle may have been violated.

**Other**:
- **Secure Payments**:\
Payments through the service should be secure and robust.

### What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?

- **Coercive Advertisements**:\
The use of targeted and possibly invasive advertisements raises concerns about the platform.
- **Restrictive Features**:\
By limiting features for non-paying users, the full extent of friends.com can be made exclusive to users based on socio-economic status.
- **Inferiority of Free Version**:\
The stark differences between the free and paid versions of the service, such as limited profile viewing, location settings and filtering ability, mean that the service may be inept if not paid for. This could pressure users into paying for the service.
- **Luring Trial Periods**:\
Offering trial periods for the paid service could also be seen as coercing users into paying for the service.

###Â What could the company do to address these issues?

Legal:
- Implement a means of obtaining consent where users can opt in and out of sharing their location data for advertisements, ensuring they are fully aware of how their data is processed.
- Collect only data that is necessary for the communicated purpose.
- Communicate clearly the purpose of data collection.
- Ensure any paid services comply with relevant financial regulations. Use secure payment gateways and encrypt payment data.

Ethical:
- Avoid aggressive advertisement tactics. Keep ads relevant and non-invasive. Give users the option to opt in and out of targeted ads.
- Ensure that the free version of the service is enough for users to have a meaningful experience.
- Offer fair pricing for the premium version to ensure it is affordable to people of all socioeconomic 
- Avoid using trial periods to pressure customers into paying for the service, instead use them to sincerely convey the benefits of the premium version.
